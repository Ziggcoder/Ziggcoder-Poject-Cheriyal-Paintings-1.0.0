                <p>Cheriyal Scroll Painting is a popular and modified version of Nakashi art, considered highly rich in the local motifs. This art form is unique to the state of Telangana and made mostly in Hyderabad currently.</p>
                <p>These scrolls are painted in narrative format similar to a film roll or even comic strips, and depict stories from the Indian mythology as well as the shorter stories related to the Puranas and Epics. Scroll paintings are known for their rich history and they also assume a significant role among Asiaâ€™s artistic traditions. The Cheriyal paintings represent a distinct local invention, based mainly on local traditions.</p>
                <p>The Nakashis are the artists of Telangana and the scrolls constitute a key element of the social and cultural setting of Telangana. These paintings were mostly confined to Cheriyal village, and hence called Cheriyal scrolls. The scrolls earlier depicted the adventures and the exploits of local folk heroes wherein each community had its popular heroes. This traditional art form is considered an inseparable part of the profession comprising the story-telling and balladeer community called Kaki Padagollu. They have displayed these scrolls which are also accompanied by music and dance. The scrolls would be flowing like a film roll, which is usually nearly three feet in width and about 40 to 45 feet in length, based on the story.</p>

                    In the urge of saving the heritage and the art. Years ago, As a child, he learned the Cheriyal craft from his father along with his studies, as time flies his hobby became his education then his education became his passion and now his passion became his job. Here we have, Mr D Venkat Ramana. He completed his BFA in Painting from Sri Venkateshwara College of Fine Arts at Madhapur to follow his Ancestral craft. The happiest part of him is that his whole family contributes their part to the craft, his wife follows the art more immensely as compared to him. His passion leads him to the roads of appreciation and respect. He was also awarded national and several state-level awards.
                    His ancestors have been practising this art for decades, now he is trying to forward it from all his soul and heart, stated Mr Venkat. He is also teaching but not forcing his children to forward their legacy. As it is his talent the craft Is his pride.
